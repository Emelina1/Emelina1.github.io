						<h1>Nubi portfolio bot  üõéÔ∏è</h1><br>
						<li><b>Tools used: </b> Dialogueflow ES / Lucidchart / Github</li>
						<li><b>Timeframe:</b> 3 weeks</li><br>	

						<h2>Interaction goals</h2>
						<p>Serve as a guide to walk users through the portfolio projects transmitting the main project concept to engage them into learning more about it.<br>  
						As a secondary goal, be capable of answering general questions through defined intents.</p>
						<h2>Technology</h2>
						<p>I used Dialogflow Messenger integration to embed the chatbot on the Porfolio website, since with this project I also wanted to familiarize myself with this platform. I migrated the portfolio to a GitHub repository in order to embed the chatbot widget in the site. This integration option allowed me to use custom payloads to include rich responses, so I could explore different reply formats.</p>
						<h2>Chatbot scope</h2>
						<p>The welcome message prompts users towards the main interaction goal followed by a button that leads to Browse projects. An invitation to use free text is followed by an open question indicating the scope of the bot. </p>
						<h2>Content architecture</h2>
						<p>A main path based on closed ended options guides users through projects. When they indicate they‚Äôre done, a Farewell flow invites them to leave a feedback and to inform on the purpose of their visit.
						Alternatively, users can ask questions for which general intents were created. To keep the interaction brief and effective, links to the About me or Connect page are offered for further information. 
						A Fallback path and an Off-scope path are considered. The latter gathers questions that are not applicable or appropriate for the bot to handle, such as those involving personal information or details better handled in a personalized way.<br>
						This is what a final draft of the content mapping looked like:</p>		
						<span class="image main"><img src="images/Nubi1.jpeg" alt="" /></span>								
						<h2>Bot Persona</h2>
						<p>I wanted the chatbot persona to keep a serious, professional tone especially while describing work and processes. Serving primarily as a guide, it helped imagining a cultured, discrete and efficient concierge speaking out the dialogues in my head while writing them (his tone is low pitched, soft and slightly musical). Additionally, I wanted to make sure a close and direct treatment was kept through informal acknowledgements and occasional personality hints, such as when introducing Nubi, a project on his own self. </p>
						<h2>Dialogues</h2>
						<p>After the first draft was written, a revision reduced a lot of redundancies, making sure the dialogue was kept brief and fresh. Moreover, information was sliced keeping only key points I wanted users to receive with an optional access to a detailed section. A lot of simplification was achieved at this point, as well as making sure the desired tone was consistent enough throughout the conversation.</p>
